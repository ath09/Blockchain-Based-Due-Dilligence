## 📝Description
This project implements a **Decentralized KYC (Know Your Customer)** verification system using **Blockchain and IPFS**. It aims to eliminate repetitive KYC procedures by storing verifiable credentials securely on a distributed ledger. Institutions can access customer identity records via **smart contracts** only with user consent. The system ensures **tamper-proof**, **transparent**, and **real-time KYC validation** with enhanced privacy and data control.

### Key Features:
1. Identity document upload and hashing via IPFS.
2. Immutable KYC record registration on Blockchain.
3. User-controlled data sharing using smart contracts.
4. Secure access logs and permission control.
5. Reduces redundancy in repeated KYC processes.
